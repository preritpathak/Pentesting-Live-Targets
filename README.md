# Week 9 - Pentesting-Live-Targets

> Objective: For this assignment, you will attack three live targets, each of which is a slightly modified version of the same web application, Globitek. The three targets are therefore mostly identical. However, each target has been given a different color menu bar—blue, green, red—and each one has two different security vulnerabilities.

> Your challenge is to attempt to find and exploit the vulnerabilities. The goal is to identify which two vulnerabilities the blue target has, which two vulnerabilities the green target has, and which two vulnerabilities the red target has.
 Given ip address: `https://35.184.134.15/`

## Goals

The following goals must be completed:

- [x] **Username Enumeration** : A careless developer mistake has created a username enumeration vulnerability. Determine which color has the vulnerability. You can use the existing username "jmonroe99" as a test. Next, figure out what mistake the developer made.

> GREEN 

When an existing user tries to login with a wrong password on the Green site, we get an error message in bold. Otherwise, we get an unstrong error message. The Red and the Blue sites prevented this by redirecting the user to the original.
